               All you have to do is SSH into your OVH server. Copy paste all IP tables, nothing else till the bottom of this document
           After that you see a command about save and reboot on bottom of this document. Type that in, refresh and your OVH is fully filtered
                                  This is basically a copy paste tutorial, easy to use and easy to understand.
